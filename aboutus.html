          Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads
          to the degeneration and death of brain cells, causing a continuous
          decline in memory, thinking, behavior, and social skills. It is the
          most common cause of dementia, a group of brain disorders that result
          in the loss of intellectual and social skills severe enough to
          interfere with daily functioning.

          Alzheimer's disease is a complex and challenging condition that
          affects millions of people worldwide. While there is currently no
          cure, ongoing research is dedicated to finding effective treatments
          and potential preventive measures. Early diagnosis and intervention,
          along with support for patients and caregivers, are essential in
          managing the disease and improving quality of life.
